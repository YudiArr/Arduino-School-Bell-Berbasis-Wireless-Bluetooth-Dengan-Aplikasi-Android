# Arduino-School-Bell-Berbasis-Wireless-Bluetooth-Dengan-Aplikasi-Android
Many schools still use simple bells that must be rung manually during class changes. To address this, we developed an Arduino School Bell using Bluetooth and an Android application. Utilizing an Arduino Nano microcontroller and Kodular app, the bell can be automatically scheduled without manual intervention. With a Real Time Clock, the bell operates smoothly with a delay of about 19 seconds if the temperature is stable. This solution makes it easier for teachers to manage the bell without manual input.
